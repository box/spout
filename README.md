Spout is a PHP library to read and write spreadsheet files (CSV, XLSX and ODS), in a fast and scalable way.
Contrary to other file readers or writers, it is capable of processing very large files while keeping the memory usage really low (less than 3MB).

## Documentation

Full documentation can be found at [https://opensource.box.com/spout/](https://opensource.box.com/spout/).


## Requirements

* PHP version 7.1 or higher
* PHP extension `php_zip` enabled
* PHP extension `php_xmlreader` enabled

## Upgrade guide

Version 3 introduced new functionality but also some breaking changes. If you want to upgrade your Spout codebase from version 2 please consult the [Upgrade guide](UPGRADE-3.0.md). 

## Running tests

The `master` branch includes unit, functional and performance tests.
If you just want to check that everything is working as expected, executing the unit and functional tests is enough.

* `phpunit` - runs unit and functional tests
* `phpunit --group perf-tests` - only runs the performance tests

For information, the performance tests take about 10 minutes to run (processing 1 million rows files is not a quick thing).

> Performance tests status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/box/spout.svg?branch=perf-tests)](https://travis-ci.org/box/spout)
